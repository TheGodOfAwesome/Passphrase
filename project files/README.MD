Passphrase app

==============

Passphrase is a suite of apps built for two factor authentication 
using one time password (OTP)

To run

1. Add the Unity Bank files to your local host (i.e. www folder in wamp 
   or htdocs in xampp)

2. Run the netbeans java server on the same host as the unity bank host 
   so they can communicate.

3. Run the android source on an emulator on the host pc.

4. Start the  java server to the begin generating OTPs and sending to the
   android application.

/************************************************/

Note 
Make sure that the IP addresses in both the Java server and the android 
application are the same as the IP address of the host computer.

Make sure that the port value for the Java server and the android app
are identical.

The Java Server, the site using the two factor authentication and the
android application can be hosted remotely but that will require some 
adjustment to the source files.
